1.13 (2023-07-12)
-----------------

- Added `BaseARUOBatchActionForm`, a class factorizing the action that
  `add/remove/update/overwrite` values on an attribute of an object

  for other similar actions. `LabelsBatchActionForm` is now based on that
  `BaseARUOBatchActionForm`.

  [sgeulette]

1.7 (2021-07-16)
----------------

- Adapted code to be able to display several tables on same page
  (and so several batchactions viewlets):

  - Added possibility to define the name of the `CheckBoxColumn`
    (still `select_item` by default);
  - Introduce idea of section for the viewlet and the batch actions so it is
    possible to display different actions on different viewlets or different
    views of same context.

  [gbastien]
- Added method `BaseBatchActionForm._final_update` called when every other
  `update` methods have been called.

  may be changed to fit the current batch action.
  [gbastien]
- Added `DeleteBatchActionForm` a delete elements batch action.
  [gbastien]

  [gbastien]

----------------

- After action applied, do not reload the entire page,
  just reload the current faceted results.
  [gbastien]
- Use `CheckBoxFieldWidget` instead `SelectFieldWidget` to manage labels to
  (un)select in `LabelsBatchActionForm` to avoid manipulation with
  `CTRL+click` for selection. Adapted and rationalized translations.
  [gbastien]
- Add a `collective.fingerpointing` entry when applying action to know
  which action was applied on how much elements.
  [gbastien]

1.5 (2020-04-23)

  [gbastien]

0.3 (2017-11-30)

- Renamed `BatchActionForm` to `BaseBatchActionForm` to show that it is the base
  form to inherit from to build new batch action.  Make it inherit from
  `Form` instead `EditForm`.
  [gbastien]
- Refactored the way form is updated and applied : two methods are there to be
  overrided : `_update` that is called in the `update` process and `_apply` that
  is called by `handleApply`.  This way it is easy to build an new action
  without having to think about basic default behavior.
  [gbastien]
- In the `TransitionBatchActionForm`, sort selectable transitions alphabetically.
  [gbastien]

0.2 (2017-11-24)
----------------

- Use `getMultiAdapter` instead `restrictedTraverse` when getting the form
  in the viewlet to speed up things.
  [gbastien]
- Added attribute `button_with_icon` to a batch action, if set to True,
  a particular CSS class is added to the button so it can be skinned
  with an icon easily.
  [gbastien]
- Register a `batch_actions.css` resource for basic styling.
  [gbastien]
